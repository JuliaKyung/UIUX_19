    <p>
        My name is Julia - thanks for visiting! Let me tell you a little bit about myself!
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born in South Korea, but was adopted when I was a baby - I was told 
        that I was placed on a plane with a lot of other babies and had a tag on 
        my wrist that said who my new parents were. Pretty interesting! 
        I grew up in Silver City, New Mexico before moving to Tucson, Arizona.
         I took some Japanese and Illustration courses and eventually majored in
          Fine Arts at the University of Arizona and minoring in Japanese.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduating, I moved to Japan in order to teach English I worked in 
        a small town in Tokushima called Tsurugi and lived over in Handa. I taught
         Junior High School students and coached them on their English speeches 
         as well as assisted in developing activities, quizzes and games.
    </p>
    <p>
        After about two years, I felt the need to change my career and move on to
         something that I could really throw myself into. So, I left Tokushima 
         and moved to Tokyo with the savings I had from working on JET.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon moving to Tokyo, I opened up a Patreon and started freelancing my art
         and design skills. I joined the Twitch community and helped my friend 
         along with other Twitch affiliates and partners create and develop their
          online personas with graphics and illustrations. I learned quite a bit
           about graphic design and advertisement in general. Though, I needed
            to find something a bit more stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started to teach myself how to code by taking a few free online
         introductory courses to JavaScript and found that it was actually fun!
          I then took an advanced engineering bootcamp to solidify my learning.
           I was able to make unique contributions to my final team project where
            I combined my design skills to create new characters for an AR game app.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduation, I found myself once again drawn to design, and pursued 
        UI/UX Design. It was far more different than I had ever imagined, but as 
        I continued to learn more about the research and design process, I couldn't
         help but feel like I found my "home" so to speak. Being able to craft 
         personas and really get into problem solving and designing was something 
         that was so fun for me. As I continued my learning, I joined the University
          of Arizona's UI/UX Program in order to build my portfolio and really get 
          myself up to speed with the wide world of Design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout this course, I had been able to realize that I had a lot of 
        these skills such as storyboarding, sketching, and even wireframing, but
         I had never been able to put a word to it. Pretty exciting! I hope that 
         with my graduation I'll be able to join a fantastic team and work on 
         designing amazing apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        My current life story has many parts, but I really am happy with the path 
        that I've chosen in UI/UX Design - I've found it's truly the perfect blend 
        of Art and Human Interaction that I've been craving.

        <center><h3>User Interface Design</h3></center>
        <p>I love being able to utilize my background in design and art to be able
             to create new and interesting interfaces that additionally work for 
             many types of users and apps.</p>

            <p>Connecting frames and problem-solving in how to best conduct a 
                transition or menu navigation is something I’ve found to be 
                extremely fun and relaxing, in a sense.</p>

            <p>Having a background in art, I’m very comfortable creating 
                storyboards for comics and other situations. Being able to pivot 
                it for user experience has been very rewarding.</p>
